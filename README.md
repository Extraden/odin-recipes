# Odin Recipes

Website with some great recipes

This is my first project on GitHub. The project is gonna test my knowledge of HTML and git. At start it is gonna be made just with HTML. Probably later I will return to the project to apply my knowledge of CSS.

## Description

Odin Recipes is a simple website showcasing a collection of delicious recipes. The project aims to demonstrate proficiency in HTML development and version control using git. Initially, the website will be constructed using HTML only, with plans to incorporate CSS styling in future iterations.

## Getting Started

To view the project locally, simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
